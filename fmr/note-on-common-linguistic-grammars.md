## Formal Language Aspect of Grammar

From the aspect of formal languages, we know there are mainly four types of grammar.

* Type-0: Unrestricted
* Type-1: Context-Sensitive Grammar
* Type-2: Context-Free Grammar
* Type-3: Regular Grammar

The larger the number, the stricter and less expressive the grammar. By less expressive we means the less language could be generated from that grammar.

It is common to augment a CFG with some extensions, making it more powerful and expressive. Some examples are as follows,

* Generalized CFG
* Linear Context-Free Rewriting Grammar, which as its name suggested is a subclass of GCFG
* Head Grammar is less powerful LCFRG
* Indexed Grammar is another kind of CFG
* Linear Indexed Grammar is a specialized Indexed Grammar
