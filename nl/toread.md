> On the machine learning side, we tried dozens of different models, from CNNs to bi-LSTMs, but ended up using a more traditional flat model called a linear chain Conditional Random Field (CRF). We also replaced the heavy word embeddings by a carefully crafted set of features that capture semantic and structural signals from the sentence. We found that there was no significant gain using deep learning versus CRFs for Natural Language Understanding tasks.
